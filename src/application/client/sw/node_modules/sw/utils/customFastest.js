 *
 * Fastest Strategy
 * The fastest strategy checks cache and network, returns whichever wins the
 * race. The network result always updates the cache for next time.
 *
 * Custom Fastest Strategy
 * The custom fastest strategy is like the fastest strategy except, in the
 * network case, if the cache update would result in an actual difference, AND
 * a stale cached copy was served, a message is sent that notifies the UI.

/**
 * A customized fastest cache strategy.
 * Race network and cache, return the first responder.
 * When network finally returns, update the cache.
 * If network caused an update making the prior response stale, notify UI.
 *
 * Specializations:
 *
 * Allows fetch and cache with two different versions of the request:
 *   One version for fetching the response from the network.
 *   One version for cache matching/updating.
 * This is a common service worker pattern that works around lack of
 * ignoreSearch implementation, but could also be useful for ignoring arbitrary
 * components of the request url in the cache, network cookie preservation,
 * changing VARY, etc.
 * @see https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=426309
 *
 * contentUpdate is called if the network response is different than a prior
 * cached response, and the route handler already responded with what must be
 * a stale response from cache.
 *
 * @param {Function} fetchRequest - Produces the network request, given the
 * original.
 * @param {Function} cacheRequest - Produces the cache request, given the
 * original.
 * @param {Function} contentUpdate - Called if a network request caused a
 * content update AND a stale response was returned prior.
 * @return {Function} An sw-toolbox route handler (request, values, options)
